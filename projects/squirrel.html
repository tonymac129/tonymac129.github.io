    <p>
      Click. The file is downloaded into the flash drive. The computer monitor
      said. The year was 2042 and I had just finished working on a research
      document in the university. It wasn&rsquo;t just any ordinary document. It
      was the work of many generations and thousands of people working together
      for decades. And now it was all me. I had just finished the final
      inspection and proofread, and it was time to submit it to the professors
      and the public. So what&rsquo;s the big deal with this document? It was
      the theory that completed the knowledge of time, space, energy,
      multiverse, blackholes, big bang&#8230; and pretty much every modern
      science mysteries. It was the theory of everything in the universe, and by
      using its concept, people could build clean energy generators,
      teleporters, time machines, and every single device in sci-fi movies, and
      beyond. It was the most important research in all of human history. My
      mind was literally exploding from the excitement and satisfaction of our
      amazing work and the future of humanity we could achieve.<br />
      Because the professors only accepted in-person submission, I needed to
      head over to the huge majestic building next to the central park of the
      university.<br />
      I woke up on the bench in the park. My mind was blank for seconds, trying
      to remember what had happened. The last thing I remembered was walking
      into the park with me firmly holding the USB drive containing the document
      in my hand. Wait, the USB drive! It wasn&rsquo;t in my hands. My body
      suddenly froze and was overwhelmed by the anxiety of the flash drive
      missing. I searched through all my pockets, the bench, even inside the
      bushes, but all I could find was panic and breakdown and mad. Just as I
      was about to go insane, a brown thing moved from the right next to a tree.
      It was just a plain squirrel.<br />
      &ldquo;Dude!&rdquo; someone said behind me. I turned around but saw
      nothing.<br />
      &ldquo;Remember me? You saved my life!&rdquo; The sound said, souded a
      little sharp and sqeuaky-like.Now I was officially crazy. No one was in
      sight. Until, finally, the squirrel came out of nowhere and started to
      speak!<br />
      &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t crazy and I&rsquo;m the squirrel you saved 14
      years ago!&rdquo; The squirrel said.<br />
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know and I don&rsquo;t care about you because I have
      a more important problem than a stupid talking squirrel!&rdquo; I yelled
      furiously, only thinking about the loss of the flash drive.<br />
      &ldquo;No need to worry, Tony, I&rsquo;m gonna save you from whatever
      problem you&rsquo;re facing!&rdquo;<br />
      &ldquo;You know my name?&rdquo;<br />
      &ldquo;Yeah, and I really appreciate that you saved my life, so I needed
      to pay back for you!&rdquo;<br />
      &ldquo;Sure, but you&rsquo;re not gonna be able to help me, because I
      don&rsquo;t remember anything on what happened to the flash
      drive!&rdquo;<br />
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know the problem, and you&rsquo;re already
      judging my ability? Give me a try!&rdquo;<br />
      &ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; I explained to him all the stuff, from how we started
      the research to meeting him.<br />
      He was a good listener, he didn&rsquo;t interrupt or say anything during
      my explanation.<br />
      &ldquo;First of all, we needed to find the flash drive.&rdquo; Duh, I was
      starting to think the squirrel wouldnt be any help until he said,
      &ldquo;You can organize a team with your other scientists and make a flash
      drive tracking device.&rdquo;<br />
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually not a bad idea! Welcome to the team, whatever
      your name is!&rdquo; We got to work right away. I was beginning to feel
      some hope!<br />
      &ldquo;Because the drive was specially designed for secured file storing,
      it has a unique element in it. We could build a tracker based on that
      element&rsquo;s traits and go to the park and search!&rdquo; one of my
      friends said.<br />
      &ldquo;So we need these: &#8230;&rdquo; We discussed possible solutions
      and built it in less than an hour! The final product looked like a phone
      from the old times with a big switch. I took it out to the park with the
      squirrel.<br />
      &ldquo;First we should go to the bench where we met and find if the drive
      is near there.&rdquo; The squirrel suggested.<br />
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been working together for a while now, but I still
      don&rsquo;t know your name!&rdquo; I came to a realization.<br />
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s @*#^$(*, in squirrel language, but I don't have an
      English name.&rdquo;<br />
      &ldquo;How about Squeaky, because you squeak a lot?&rdquo; I suggested.<br />
      &ldquo;That works for me!&rdquo; He said. We walked around the bench and
      the whole park for the day, and finally, at evening, the tracker began
      beeping rapidly next to a treehole. The hole was really high up in the old
      tree, only Squeaky could reach it. He climbed up, into the treehole, and
      disappeared for a really long time. I became more and more impatient until
      he reached his head out from the dark treehole.<br />
      &ldquo;You gotta come up and see this.&rdquo; He said excitedly.<br />
      The tree didn&rsquo;t have any limbs low enough for me to climb so I found
      a ladder next to the bench (???) and put it leaning against the tree.
      Squeaky helped me adjust the ladder and I climbed up. The treehole seemed
      small down there but it was just big enough for me to fit through! It was
      way bigger than I&rsquo;d imagined, because we crawled deeper and deeper,
      like crawling in a tunnel.<br />
      &ldquo;Wait, Squeaky&#8230; I thought this was a treehole, not a
      tunnel?&rdquo;<br />
      &ldquo;The exciting part is coming!&rdquo; We crawled for like an hour,
      until I was about to head back because this seemed hopeless, but far in
      the deepest corner, there was a beam of light shooting in.<br />
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an exit???&rdquo;<br />
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not even that exciting compared to what you are about
      to see.&rdquo; We crawled faster and faster and I could start seeing the
      green trees showing up, and a big gray object on the front.<br />
      &ldquo;What in the world is that gray thing? How is that in a treehole? Is
      this a portal?&rdquo; I was so confused.<br />
      &ldquo;IDK, but I think the USB drive is in the gray thing.&rdquo; We
      finally crawled out of the long tunnel and we could clearly see that the
      huge enormous object was actually a fort-looking building but we
      couldn&rsquo;t see the top because it was too tall. Around it were several
      smaller buildings, surrounded by a sea of dark green trees without an end.
      A weird thing was that there weren't any people around.<br />
      &ldquo;What is this place?&rdquo; I asked again for the 329457 time.<br />
      &ldquo;I already told you, I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; Squeaky said
      impatiently.<br />
      &ldquo;Well, I guess the only thing we can do right now is go in and try
      to find the USB?&rdquo;<br />
      &ldquo;Nice! I love adventures!&rdquo; Turns out, the tunnel exit was
      actually another tree&rsquo;s treehole, except this time, it was higher,
      about 20 feet off the ground. Luckily for me, I could jump down. Because
      in this world, gravity worked really weird. I landed slowly, felt like
      floating in the water but sinking really slowly.<br />
      &ldquo;Let me think, if the gravity pull is so weak, and considering the
      gravitational formula and the particles in this place, we&rsquo;re
      probably on a mars-sized planet!&rdquo; I concluded using my science
      skills.<br />
      &ldquo;Does that mean we teleported to trillions of trillions of trillions
      of miles away?&rdquo;<br />
      &ldquo;Possibly, but probably even further!&rdquo; I said.<br />
      &ldquo;I think we should probably disguise ourselves to get in, just in
      case.&rdquo; Right after I finished saying, a human-like creature and a
      squirrel-like creature walked out from the tiny entrance on the right of
      the huge building. <br />
      &ldquo;Wait&#8230; what the-?&rdquo; we both said at the same time. I was
      getting more and more confused by the second.<br />
      &ldquo;Pure luck, I guess,&rdquo; Squeaky said.<br />
      &ldquo;That means we could just go in normally, right?&rdquo;<br />
      &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no problem so far, just get in, find the USB,
      and get back to the professors, easy peasy.&rdquo; We agreed. We had no
      idea how important this adventure would be to the whole universe, and what
      adventure awaited us.<br />
      With the tracker beeping more and more like crazy, I started to wonder if
      the tracker was broken. Until I finally realized, &ldquo;This building is
      made out of the same special metal in the USB drive, and it could be in
      other places in the park! We just wasted a lot of time!&rdquo;<br />
      &ldquo;Calm down, I have a feeling the drive is in here.&rdquo; Squeaky
      said calmly.<br />
      &ldquo;Your feeling? What?&rdquo; I was getting madder by the second.<br />
      &ldquo;Just trust me, I&rsquo;m gonna make this quick.&rdquo; He said.<br />
      &ldquo;Fine, it&rsquo;s not like there&rsquo;s any other choices.&rdquo; I
      said while turning off the super annoying USB tracker. We arrived at the
      main lobby, where a bunch of boxes were located. &ldquo;Creatures&rdquo;
      were starting to appear, some bug-like, very few fish-like, and most of
      them were not possible to describe with human languages.<br />
      &ldquo;They seemed to be accepting us, this place is probably somekind of
      space depot or exchange station, like those in the movies, that&rsquo;s
      why this building is full of different creatures and this enormous.&rdquo;
      Squeaky said.<br />
      &ldquo;What are these boxes for?&rdquo; I said while watching an alien
      doing stuff near a box. After some moments, it (or he? She? ???) jumped in
      the box and disappeared.<br />
      &ldquo;I bet that&rsquo;s a teleporter!&rdquo; Squeaky said excitedly. We
      got to one of the boxes. There was a 3D holograph levitating next to the
      super high-tech machine box.<br />
      &ldquo;See, this would be one of the things the theory could achieve for
      humanity!&rdquo; I explained to Squeaky. He gave me a device next to the
      holograph and I put it next to my eye. The holograph and all the language
      around us instantly became English.<br />
      &ldquo;A translating goggle? Sick!&ldquo; I looked at the holograph and it
      had a complete directory of the floors.<br />
      &ldquo;Which level do we need to go?&rdquo; I asked.<br />
      &ldquo;Why would you ask me? You&rsquo;re the scientist here.&rdquo;
      Squeaky said.<br />
      &ldquo;Alright, let me think. So this is a place where aliens put their
      goods, materials, and stuff here to exchange with other planets or
      civilizations, like trades between countries&#8230;the treehole back on
      Earth may actually be the only secret passageway from Earth to here! The
      USB drive probably came out from the exit we came out of, and some manager
      or worker here found it, and they probably thought this was a material for
      exchange, so they probably put it in some place to
      organize&#8230;&rdquo;<br />
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a really genius thinker, you know that right?&rdquo;
      Squeaky complimented me.<br />
      &ldquo;Let me see&#8230;hmm, rare metals and devices&#8230;humans
      archive&#8230;ground breaking research&#8230;blah blah blah&#8230;these
      could all be possible!&rdquo; I listed 10 different possible levels out of
      1258 total levels of the building.<br />
      &ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s go through each one of them!&rdquo; Squeaky
      concluded.<br />
      First possible level: Rare metals and devices. I clicked the level, hopped
      into the box, with Squeaky next to me, and as soon as I pressed the
      hologram button, I felt like falling, just as I was about to die (or at
      least that&rsquo;s how I felt) My feet dropped onto the solid ground.
      I&rsquo;d never been so relieved and so appreciated that I was standing<br />
      &ldquo;That was actually kind of fun!&rdquo; We said simultaneously. That
      was another technology the theory could lead to, and without those falling
      feelings. This level was as big as two football fields and it was full of
      shelves with holograms on the sides showing what materials the shelf
      contains for the space goods exchangers.<br />
      &ldquo;This place has really good organizations!&rdquo; Squeak said.<br />
      &ldquo;You go search from the left, and I&rsquo;ll go from the
      right.&rdquo; I ordered. The first shelf has gold. The whole shelf was
      shining like crazy, it was golder than all of the gold on Earth combined!
      Just imagine a shelf longer than a train, two stories tall, all filled
      with gold!<br />
      &ldquo;I wish I could get some of this&#8230;&rdquo; I said under my
      breath. Unfortunately, all the materials were locked by a biological lock,
      only employees or specially permitted people could open the locks. The
      second shelf was iron, the third copper&#8230;every single metal element
      material was followed. As I was reaching shelf 108, Squeaky yelled from
      the center of the room. <br />
      &ldquo;Come to shelf 143 and look at this!&rdquo; I ran there as fast as I
      could. The hologram read &ldquo;Pre high-tech devices&rdquo; Pre
      high-tech, probably means the most advanced technologies humanity has ever
      invented except the designs and the documents stored in the USB drive.<br />
      &ldquo;Here at bay 23 are the human devices!&rdquo; Squeaky said while
      searching on the top of the shelf.<br />
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look from the bottom.&rdquo; I said while looking at old
      TVs and iPhones from my childhood. Old memories came into my mind,
      remembering I did a squirrel story assignment from Mr. Rocchi&rsquo;s
      English class back in middle school!<br />
      &ldquo;How come there&rsquo;s no robots to help? I thought there would be
      lots of machines here!&rdquo; I asked Squeaky while looking at an AC
      machine and some car scraps.<br />
      &ldquo;I have no idea.&rdquo; Squeaky said, while I climbed up one layer
      on the shelf. <br />
      &ldquo;One more question, how in the world did the USB drive come here and
      I don&rsquo;t remember a single thing?&rdquo; I asked, feeling extremely
      clouded.<br />
      &ldquo;There could be one possible solution&#8230;maybe the employees here
      saw you wandering near the tunnel that connects to Earth and thought you
      were submitting something to the space depot? And because of security
      reasons they erased your memory and put you on the bench using alien
      technologies? Just guessing.&rdquo;<br />
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a genius! That explained every mystery we&rsquo;ve
      encountered so far!&rdquo; I complemented.<br />
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just hope there won&rsquo;t be any more.&rdquo; Squeaky
      responded.<br />
      &ldquo;Here it is! File storing devices!&rdquo; I said. Tons of drives,
      phones, and hard drives were in the basket, and we slowly went through all
      of them, but there were only two USB drives and they both weren&rsquo;t
      ours, and they looked really old, maybe even 50 years old!<br />
      Second possible level: Humans and low civilizations archive. <br />
      &ldquo;Look! They see humans as &ldquo;low civilizations&rdquo;!&rdquo; I
      said, feeling funny.<br />
      This level was full of human stuff you would see from a person&rsquo;s
      house to the world&rsquo;s most protected museums! It had shelves of human
      clothes, books, buildings (small houses that could fit in this gigantic
      room) tools, food, products, and some other common daily tools we used
      from tens of thousands of years ago to right now. We got through each
      aisle but found nothing about technology.<br />
      &ldquo;The tech stuff is probably all at the previous level.&rdquo;
      Squeaky said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Third possible level: Ground breaking research. Most of the were ancient
      documents presented in a hologram in alien languages, and because they
      were too outdated for normal civilizations, our goggles couldn&rsquo;t
      translate them. Until we got to an aisle that said &ldquo;Universe &amp;
      Physics Reseach&rdquo;.<br />
      &ldquo;This is it!&rdquo; Squeaky said while going through different
      sections of the shelf, &ldquo;Here! This is the section for timespace and
      physics mysteries!&rdquo; Most of them were also more modern alien
      holograms that the goggles could translate, but still no sign of the USB
      drive.<br />
      Just like that, we went to different levels, finding the most possible
      shelf, and going to the most related bay, and failed to find anything.
      Until level 999, the last level, and the level for &ldquo;super duper mega
      big classified secured double-protected triple-guarded preserved files and
      objects.&rdquo;<br />
      &ldquo;Who named this level?&rdquo; Squeaky asked, almost laughing in
      tears.<br />
      &ldquo;Well, apparently, this level has very loose guards, we could just
      get our files and leave, right?&rdquo;<br />
      We got out of the teleporter and we were shocked. It was a huge gigantic
      black wall in front of us, with no entrance except a square passageway
      with a really high-tech looking entrance that was glowing in gray lights,
      guarded by two bug-like creatures and an army of mechanical dog-elephant
      creatures.<br />
      &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s where all the robots are.&rdquo; Squeaky said
      bitterly.<br />
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try to break in!!!&rdquo; I said excitedly.<br />
      &ldquo;Not so fast, let&rsquo;s see the creatures over there, they seemed
      like some really important people!&rdquo; Squeaky said.<br />
      &ldquo;While the guards were distracted by them, let&rsquo;s try to find a
      way and get in!&rdquo; I said. Considering the wall was completely sealed
      with really strong metal and possibly armed with weapons, we
      couldn&rsquo;t get in from this side of the wall.<br />
      &ldquo;Squeaky, I have an idea.&rdquo; I told him the idea and he agreed,
      but this could get really dangerous.<br />
      Level 229 through 254: Transportations and mechanical tools. Squeaky got
      the size-changine machines and I got the teleporter and a driller, both
      were unlocked because of some reason.<br />
      &ldquo;Danger, do not smallify any creature or object to one-fifth of its
      original height.&rdquo; Squeaky read the directions on the
      flashlight-looking machine.<br />
      &ldquo;Dang it, we can&rsquo;t sneak in by becoming smaller than invisible
      now.&rdquo; I said, but quickly came up with a plan b and Squeaky
      agreed.<br />
      &ldquo;Okay, so I will smallify you to about 3 inches long, along with the
      teleporter, the biglifier, and the driller, got it?&rdquo; I confirmed.<br />
      &ldquo;No problem!&rdquo; He said confidently.<br />
      I switched the switch to &frac14; place (the goggles also came with number
      system exchange, by the way) and pressed the bottom on the hologram, and
      Squeaky became so small!<br />
      &ldquo;It worked!&rdquo; He said, turning on the mini driller and started
      drilling a hole on the metal with full speed.<br />
      Half an hour later, the slightly-noisy sound stopped, and there was a tiny
      hole, about half an inch wide.<br />
      &rdquo;You think you can fit through?&rdquo; I asked hopefully.<br />
      &ldquo;Yes, it fits perfectly!&rdquo; Squeaky squeaked, climbing through
      the hole, soon disappearing from my sight. I started setting up the
      teleporter from my side and adjusting the codes to get through it
      smoothly, without any sound or stuff, else we would get busted and it
      would come to an end. A sound came from below. A huge deep sound, sounded
      like something crushing down onto the floor. I jumped into the teleporter,
      rolling out on the other end smoothly.<br />
      &ldquo;Yes! It worked!&rdquo; I said happily. The plan was that Squeaky
      would dig a hole and come down, set up the out portal, so I could get in,
      and that loud crashing sound was a distraction, created by the biglifier
      to a shelf so it would fall down, and every robot would swarm there and it
      also acted as a signal for me to come down.<br />
      &ldquo;Now that all the guards are gone we can go out easily from the
      entrance.&rdquo; I said while hurrying to find the shelf possibly
      containing the USB drive.<br />
      &ldquo;Here! Level 100 classified important documents! It reads
      &lsquo;This shelf contains important documents only for the high-level
      personnel. They shall not be leaked to non-trustworthy individuals or the
      information and the power they contain could possibly destroy the entire
      universe or create a high level danger.&rsquo; This is it! The theory
      really could be a threat to the universe if the formulas fall into some
      evil people!&rdquo; Squeaky excitedly yelled from the left shelves. I
      sprinted there as fast as I could, but there&rsquo;s a weird thing that
      wasn&rsquo;t there and I coudn&rsquo;t quite figure it out.<br />
      &ldquo;Why is it so silent?&rdquo; I asked, knowing the worst possible
      case.<br />
      As I turned into the shelf labeled ' &lsquo;Level 100 Classified
      Documents' ' , Squeaky was nowhere in sight.<br />
      &ldquo;Squeaky?&rdquo; I asked uneasily.<br />
      Suddenly, a ton of noises came from the top right corner of the room,
      coming down the shelves toward the exit.<br />
      &ldquo;Squeaky?&rdquo; I asked again feeling more anxious this time. The
      noises were like a stampede, many creatures
      stamping/crawling/flying/running down the aisle, chasing a thing. It was
      Squeaky, who had a small box with a transparent container. Through the
      transparent layer I could recognize my special USB drive right away, the
      one single target I had been looking for a day, but the adventure felt
      like weeks, even months.<br />
      &ldquo;Squeaky, wait up!&rdquo; I yelled, catching up with Squeaky while
      he ran out of the aisle next to me, a bunch of creatures turning into the
      aisle about 50 yards away, from the end of the room. They were too fast,
      there&rsquo;s no way we could escape from them&#8230;<br />
      I tripped down to the ground for a moment, and Squeaky quickly made
      several turns and disappeared from my sight. I was afraid to be caught so
      I hid behind an aisle while the creatures and the robotic army ran down.
      Then I realized. I was tripped by a small chair, probably from the
      security guards&rsquo; post near the exit. A small object, but enough to
      make a human tripp. Before I tripped, I glanced at a brown object that
      went through the bottom of the chair in a flash. It was Squeaky. Squeaky
      did it. He pulled the chair out to let me tripp. He did it. My mind could
      only think of a single word. Betrayal.<br />
      I couldn&rsquo;t believe all this time, from him showing up, to stealing
      the research, he was planning to steal the USB drive. These two days, or
      weeks, or months, he was pretending to be my friend, pretending to help
      me, just to make himself famous, to make him the &ldquo;honorable&rdquo;
      scientist. It was such a huge betrayal. USB gone, stuck in this weird
      planet, chased by a bunch of evil robots. I felt so misrable.<br />
      I slowly walked out of the damaged entrance, playing with the switch of
      the USB tracker in my pocket. I opened a mechanical door on the wall. A
      bunch of hallways were in front of me, like a maze. The traitor probably
      went this way, I thought, still very mad at the squirrel. Suddenly, a
      bunch of noises came from the far right of the huge maze. If the squirrel
      is there, he is probably being arrested right now. I thought, kind of
      satisfied by my own imagination. My tracker began beeping more and more
      rapidly, meaning the USB drive was close to me. I started hurrying down
      toward the center of the big maze, which probably served as a goods
      management system because of the trackes and tubes along the walls of the
      maze. Suddenly, the tracker died right after the most intense beeps so
      far.<br />
      &ldquo;What the&#8230;?&rdquo; I said, thinking the tracker had gotten
      broken. I bent down but saw nothing. I stood up again while turning around
      at the same time. Right then I saw it. The USB, with a coding style
      wrapping paper, is too obvious and unique to recognize. It was stuck in a
      glass tube at the bottom of the wall I was at.<br />
      &ldquo;Oh my god! It&rsquo;s here!&rdquo; I yelled. I was so
      happy/confused/surprised at the same time. It was finally found by me, but
      how? Didn&rsquo;t the squirrel steal it? Why is it here? I took it out
      from a switch in the tube and took it with me. I hurried back to the
      classified level, where the teleporter was located, and went back to level
      1, and exited this weirdest and most mysterious building I&rsquo;d ever
      seen, back to the special tree, and went back to Earth.<br />
      &ldquo;Professor Hsu, Professor Hsu, can I have your autograph?&rdquo; a
      kid asked me in a science fair I was attending.<br />
      &ldquo;Of course, and you can just call me Tony.&rdquo; I said happily
      while signing his notebook.<br />
      It was years after the USB event, and I successfully submitted the
      research to the professors in the university, who found it &ldquo;one of
      the most important, fine, and detailed science threory of all time&rdquo;.
      Because of it, me and 59 other people who gave the most on this project,
      got the honor of the Nobel Prices and became famous, because of the
      important formulas and principles in the research, humans succeeded at
      removing all carbon and gas emissions, switched to 100% green energy and a
      happier life, and the climates were back to normal, and everyone, every
      country on Earth was working hard together to achieve this. I felt really
      cheerful of what we did to people, and the beneficial impact we had on
      Earth, our precious home.<br />
      Except for the new technologies and the new ways of life, I was still
      thinking about Squeaky from time to time. How he sacrificed himself,
      pretended to betray me so the guards would only capture him, just to let
      me have the USB and bring benefits to everyone. How he thought of the
      genius plan for me to retrieve the USB and get away with it, without
      anyone even noticing me. He dedicated to help me more than what I&rsquo;d
      done, just turning my car wheel for a bit to avoid hitting him. I needed
      to pay back my loyal friend. None of these would have happened if he
      didn&rsquo;t appear.<br />
      I went back to the tree right after I submitted the documents. I found the
      bench and found out, shockingly, the tree was cut down because it was
      getting in a park trail&rsquo;s way! I felt sad. I felt sad for Squeaky,
      alone in nowhere, I felt sad for the tree, I felt sad for not getting back
      to where all these started. In these busy years, making stuff and going
      places because of the research, I barely had time to go back, or try to
      find a way back. In my very very short free time, I conducted secret
      research on the planet, everything about the space depot, and how to get
      back. I figured out a lot of interesting things, but that&rsquo;s for
      another story. I built a special tracker/navigator, and I followed its
      signals to get back to the new getaway to the planet.<br />
      &ldquo;Here it is.&rdquo; I said, satisfied. I was in the park, right next
      to the bench I met Squeaky, on another tree. I felt dumb I didn&rsquo;t
      find that out sooner. What a shock twist.<br />
      Mission: finding Squeaky solo, has begun. (I&rsquo;m still working on the
      name, sorry.)<br />
      The same exact way, I got into the gigantic building. I had no idea what
      to do now so I wore the goggles, found the only one possible level: Level
      -5, trans-space criminals.<br />
      It was cold and dark down here, just like in the movies, except the cells
      were quite high-tech and comfortable-looking. It was like a small pod with
      a few new pieces of furniture that you could live with, with a
      food-producing system. Except the pods were completely sealed with the
      strongest material in the whole universe. It was a massive level, with
      tens of thousands of cells. They catagorized the criminals by the planets
      they&rsquo;re from. Earth: 1 criminal. Name: @*#^$(* ; Species: Squirrel ;
      Crime Commited: Stealing Highly Classified Documents.<br />
      &ldquo;Squeaky!&rdquo; I yelled so happily and the situation was quite
      weird. He was crawling in a corner of his cell, not moving.<br />
      &ldquo;Squeaky? Can you hear me?&rdquo; I asked.<br />
      He suddenly turned back, looking like he&rsquo;d gone insane.<br />
      &ldquo;Ohhhh! What have they done to you?&rdquo; I asked through the holes
      for communication.<br />
      &ldquo;Tony?!!! You&rsquo;re back? What? Oh, and, sorry, my morning face.
      That&rsquo;s what happens after I wake up.&rdquo;<br />
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no time to explain! I need to rescue you from this
      garbage place!&rdquo; I said.<br />
      &ldquo;How are you here? How did you? What? Huh? I thought you? What??? I
      have so many questions right now but what are you doing here? If they
      catch you talking to me&#8230;&rdquo; Squeaky said<br />
      &ldquo;Come on, we need to go, I&rsquo;ll explain everything once you get
      out.&rdquo; I said anxiously, studying the control panel of the thing.<br />
      &ldquo;Get out? I&rsquo;m not getting out!&rdquo; Squeaky said.<br />
      &ldquo;WHAT?&rdquo; I asked, shocked.<br />
      &ldquo;I have good reasons, first, this place is COMFY, they give good
      foods everyday; second, I&rsquo;m too old and I don&rsquo;t want to drag
      you down, there will be high chances of you getting caught, and you still
      have many things to do and infinite opportunities, I believe in you; and
      third, I, um, am about to, like, um, die. Yeah. Die.&rdquo; He said.<br />
      &ldquo;WHAT???&rdquo; I was so comfused, but so touched, and so sad,
      suddenly.<br />
      &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m not going, and you should go live your own life.
      You going is the best way to pay me back. (if that&rsquo;s why
      you&rsquo;re here, I guess&#8230;)&rdquo; Squeaky squeaked.<br />
      &ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t, I need to let them know&#8230;&rdquo; I said,
      almost in tears.<br />
      &ldquo;Nah, don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m good, come on, just go, thank you
      for everything.&rdquo; Squeaky said, also looking sad.<br />
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m thanking you for everything, you know how good the
      Earth is doing right now? It&rsquo;s all because of YOU!&rdquo; I said,
      knowing what would happen next.<br />
      &ldquo;Please, just go, I&rsquo;m begging you!&rdquo; Squeaky sobbed.<br />
      &ldquo;Fine, I guess this is a goodbye, then.&rdquo; I murmured<br />
      &ldquo;Nice, now go before they see you!&rdquo; Squeaky yelled.<br />
      &ldquo;GOODBYE THANKS FOR EVERYTHING AND WITHOUT YOU I WOULD POSSIBLY BE I
      DONT EVEN KNOW JUST BYE BYE&rdquo; I said while running away, crying.<br />
      I was so absolutely astonished by what Squeaky said, after I got back on
      Earth and rethought the whole thing, almost unrealistic. I think I did the
      best thing for him. He was resting and living happily there, and he said
      that I had infinite opportunities. That touched me right there. Even
      though I was reluctant to leave Squeaky, I just needed to let it go. If
      there&rsquo;s one lesson I learned in these years, it is that you just
      gotta believe, and move on, no matter what. Because of this, the world got
      to be how it is. Thanks, Squeaky, you changed everything.
