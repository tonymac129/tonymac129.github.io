                rebranded MacWeb as a collection of web apps and tools in October 2023 and its popularity has skyrocketed ever
                since. I started earning hundreds monthly from MacWeb in December 2024 thanks to ads, and I transitioned the
                entire platform to React in July 2025 (I basically remade the entire website and it wasn't easy). This is the
                project that I've spent the most time working on, so hopefully you'll enjoy what I created.

                Since I first created MacWeb, I imagined an entire ecosystem of a bunch of different apps that could all integrate
                together (lol how naive I thought I could create all that myself) and every app can be called to do a certain task
                with a universal command bar. I soon realized there's no way to achieve this level of scale and the idea just
                became a dream. Until I got good with React and wanted to replace my old personal dashboard made with vanilla JS
                for the third time. I thought, why not make an extremely customizable dashboard with a ton of features and
                commands that act as shrotcuts to the web? Shortly after starting it, I discovered the event{" "}
                <a href="https://summer.hackclub.com" target="_blank">
                  Summer of Making

                that rewards teens with free prizes/tech/merch for coding and making cool stuff. This gave me a ton of motivation
                and I developed a lot of features and stacked 9 hours on the project in just a week. Lightning is still being
                developed and I hope to make more features in the future!

                In April 2025, as I started learning more advanced stuff like calculus and trigonometry I find it hard to remember
                and keep track of all the concepts, equations, and theorems you can use to solve certain problems in addition to
                building and remembering the intuition for how these concepts work. There's just too much to remember and I often
                find myself looking up the same thing over and over again. So I thought, why not create a simple digital notebook
                that allows me to keep track of all the things I've learned? This can definitely improve my math skills while also
                being a fun little coding exercise that's actually useful too. And that's how InfiNote was born. You can create
                your own topics, organize notes, edit them with different formatting tools, and do so much more!

                themes, and more! I made this for my peers at school to enjoy in September 2024 because MacVG got blocked, but
                lost interest and stopped updating/maintaining it in November 2024, which is why Viberverse is still partially
