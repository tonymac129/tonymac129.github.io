        If you compare cell organells to different components of a laptop
        according to their functions, a cell's mitochondria would be the battery
        of the laptop. The main function of mitochondria is that they produce
        energy that the cell can use by breaking down the chemical compounds in
        food called glucose. They break down glucose into carbon dioxide, water,
        and energy for the cell to use. Battery is pretty similar to
        mitochondria because it also converts the chemical potential energy to
        electromagnetic energy so the laptop will have electricity (energy) to
        run. Bettery turns the charged chemical energy into electricity for the
        laptop by releasing the electrons in it. Both mitochondria and battery
        turn a form of energy into another which their parent element can use to
        do things. their parent element what to do.
