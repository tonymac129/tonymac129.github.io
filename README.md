# TonyMac129
### TonyMac129 is my portfolio where I put all my projects, websites, and other stuff!  
# Update Log
- # v1.0
  ### 04/17/23
  My first time thinking about creating a portfolio website to put all my projects in. I uploaded a few projects and pages. I published it on Replit.
- # v1.5
  ### 09/19/23
  A complete revamp to the old version with new appearance, new pages, and new projects. I put it as part of the MacWeb company, where I originally thought would just be my site where I put my other apps and stuff.
- # v2.0
  ### 11/11/23
  I moved the portfolio as my personal site instead being part of the MacWeb company. I reorganized the files in the portfolio, with brand new and updated projects and contents, with a revamped and refreshed UI/UX.
- # v2.1
  ### 12/22/2023
  Uploaded some more projects and coding files, also update some visual UI and UX experience.
