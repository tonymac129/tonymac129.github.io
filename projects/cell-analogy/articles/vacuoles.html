        If you compare cell organells to different components of a laptop
        according to their functions, a cell's vacuoles would be the fans of the
        laptop. The main functions of vacuoles are storing water and nutrients
        for the cell and getting rid of the waste product. They break the large
        chemical compounds into smaller smaller molecules and send them out of
        the cell. The fans in a laptop and the cooling pad do the same thing,
        too. They get rid of the heat, or waste, created by the laptop by
        fanning, blowing, and directing the heat out of the laptop. To
        summarize, cell vacuoles and laptop fans are similar because they both
        get rid of the waste product produced by their parent element.
