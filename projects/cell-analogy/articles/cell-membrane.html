        If you compare cell organells to different components of a laptop
        according to their functions, a cell's cell membrane would be the ports
        of the laptop. The main function of a cell membrane is controlling what
        enters and leaves the cell. It keeps harmful stuff from the cell and
        makes nutrients, important chemical compounds, and oxygen be able to get
        in the cell. Laptop ports, on the other hand, also control what enters
        and what leaves the laptop. It makes it possible to connect devices to
        the laptop but keeps other stuff like pencils, paper, etc. out of the
        laptop. It also controls whether or not if pieces of information and
        files can exit the laptop. In conclusion, both cell membrane and laptop
        ports are very similar because they both control what enters and leaves
        their parent element.
