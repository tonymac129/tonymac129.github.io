      <p>
        If you compare cell organells to different components of a laptop
        according to their functions, a cell's ribosomes would be the keyboard
        and the mouse of the laptop. The main function of ribosomes is that they
        produce proteins that determine what the cell does according to the DNA
        (blueprint) from the cell nucleus. mRNA (messenger RNA) transcribes the
        blueprint stored in nucleus, carries it to the ribosomes, and ribosomes
        will make amino acid chains according to the blueprint. The amino acid
        chains are proteins that act as commands that tell the cell what to do.
        Keyboard and mouse do the same thing, too. They produce commands that
        tell the laptop what to do by recieving the user input and convert them
        into code that the CPU can process and respond to the input. So in
        conclusion, ribosomes, keyboard, and mouse are similar because they all
        make commands that tell their parent element what to do.
