        Today must be the most productive day of our long, busy, bothering, and nerve-racking days of moving. I woke up with a head full of energy and excitement, ‘cause I was about to finish the most important, and the most annoying task - ordering the stuff for remodeling the kitchen cabinets.<br>
        It was super annoying and stupid because of three reasons. One, we had THREE different kinds of plans for remodeling, and dad, mom, and me each had different choices and we were fighting over it, making everyone mad and super tired. Two, on The Home Depot’s website, there were only so many kinds of cabinets we wanted, neither of the plans fit except for the one with not-aligned cabinets. Last, I was so frustrated that our kitchen was so oldddddd that we needed specific sizes of the cabinets because we couldn’t move the stove and the sink. Consequently, all those sizes were not popular anymore and nearly no one was making them, making it mega-hard to find the sizes we needed.<br>
        To solve these BIG PROBLEMS, we needed to find if each remodeling choice had all the cabinets with correct dimensions, styling, and stuff on Home Depot’s website. After that, there would definitely be a fight to decide which one was the best choice. Unfortunately, which was very expected, it took a really long time to find all those cabinets and I was really exhausted. But on the bright side, we wrote out all the possible choices (Y.A.Y!) and…we just left it there. I guess we all needed a break from this nerve-wracking situation of different opinions and very few matching cabinets we needed.<br>
        That noon, we returned our totally-useless cable TV Contour and super-useful WIFI machine to Cox and disconnected all our services from it. We cleared out one more task! We were so glad to take a break and we needed to visit Centreville one more time for…you know, the cabinets. And moving stuff we needed to buy.<br>
        After-afternoon, we hopped in our tiny car with a trunk load of heavy books (3% of moving done!) and unsure-the-future mood with us. Basically, we had three giant big tasks (before the actual moving) like three giant mountains of pressure bearing down on us. First, deciding the new floor for our about-to-be-remodeled kitchen, which we already finished yesterday at Home Depot AND we also ordered it! Second, buying a new dishwaher because the old one was not working at all and we needed a new one. Third, and the most important one, finding the right kitchen cabinet we all agree and buying it. This trip was for the second task, dishwasher.<br>
        We arrived at a Lowe's, it was just like Home Depot, with rows and rows of home improvement tools, materials, and lots more. And with the unique smell of wood you can smell in a place like this. Amazing. After lots of boring grown-up talks and some discussions, we all aggreed to buy a cheap but usefual Samsung dishwasher. Ding! Three hours passed, one task down, hundreds of dollars gone. The dishwasher would be delivierd right after we move in!<br>
