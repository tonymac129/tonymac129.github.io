        If you compare cell organells to different components of a laptop
        according to their functions, a cell's cytoplasm would be the
        motherboard of the laptop. The main functions of cytoplasm are holding
        the cell parts and organells together, transporting nutrients, and
        keeping the cell shape. Cytoplasm is a jelly-like substance made from
        water, salt, and other stuff. A laptop's motherboard is also really like
        the cytoplasm, because it holds all the components of a laptop like CPU,
        chips, wires, battery, disks, fans, and more. If there wan't a
        motherboard all the components would be messed up and not working at
        all, same with the cytoplasm. So in conclusion, cytoplasm and
        motherboard are similar because they both keep the parts together so
        they can work with each other without a problem.
