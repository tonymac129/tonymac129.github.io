      <p>
        If you compare cell organells to different components of a laptop
        according to their functions, a cell's chloroplasts would be the power
        port of the laptop. The main function of chloroplasts is executing
        photosynthesis. They first absorb the radient energy from the sunlight,
        then use that energy to move around the electrons in the carbon dioxide
        and the water, which would result in a glucose compund and oxygen. The
        glucose would be later used by the mitochondria. The power port, on the
        other hand, leads the electricity from the charger into the battery,
        which is similar to mitochondria. Like chloroplasts give mitochondria
        glucose to use, the power port gives the battery energy. This is what
        makes them similar to each other.
