        If you compare cell organells to different components of a laptop
        according to their functions, a cell's nucleus would be the CPU of the
        laptop. The main functions of a cell nucleus are storing the genetic
        information for cell reproduction and cell function. It controls the
        cell's function by controlling and processing chemicals for gene
        expression. It stores the DNA for the cell, which tells ribosomes what
        proteins to make, and the proteins determine what the cell does. CPU, or
        Central Proccessing Unit, also controls the entire laptop. It proccesses
        almost all the information, data, and commands a user tells the laptop
        to do. It reads the machine code inputed by the user, proccesses it
        logically or arithmetically, and then send out commands to control the
        other parts of a laptop what to do, responding to the user input. In
        conclusion, cell nucleus and laptop CPU are very similar because they
        both control their parent element in some way.
